# foldit

foldit is a folding editor inspired by the editor that was integrated into the Inmos Transputer Development System (TDS).

Easiest to navgate is using the numeric keypad.

The code is very old and this is just an archive. It will be hard to compile. But there is a Windows binary above. Download it together with foldit.ini. The help file is missing.
