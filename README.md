# foldit

foldit is a folding editor inspired by the editor that was integrated into the Inmos Transputer Development System (TDS). As such it can enter files(*) as if they were folds making navigation of whole directory structures easy. 

Easiest to navgate folds using the numeric keypad.

The code is very old and this is just an archive. It will be hard to compile. But there is a Windows binary above. Download it together with foldit.ini. The help file is missing.

(*) If you click enter-fold on any line containing an item in single quotes, foldit will assume it's a file and open it in a new window.  This makes it easy to reference other files using a comment.
